tex-tutorial
============

A tutorial into the use of LaTeX.
These files were created due to a talk held by me for IEEE Student
Branch at the University of Passau, Germany.

The presentation itself can be compiled _only_ with LuaLaTeX!  If you
open the pr-ieee-main.tex in the emacs editor with AUCTeX-plugin
installed, it will readout the correct compilation parameters from the
file automatically.

All examples in the examples-directory should compile by pdfLaTeX,
except the ones for powerdot presentation class and the pstricks
examples.  These need to be compiled with latex → dvips → ps2pdf.

To make shure everything works well, I recommend an up-to-date
installation of TeX Live 2013 (see tug.org/texlive).
